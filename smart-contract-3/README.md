# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

npx hardhat --network localhost test
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js 

npx hardhat verify --contract "contracts/NFTYacht.sol:NFTYacht" --network localhost 0x26e3e87873265237172194E7418a20Df204Fbb7D "0x921e00B13562F4C3f4B677f6CaD7639562595c33"
