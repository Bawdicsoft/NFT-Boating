# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

npx hardhat --network localhost test
npx hardhat run --network test scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify --contract "contracts/Deploy.sol:Deploy" --network test 0xA21d285B39C0eeF229DC598fb3f2F950F65060B8
